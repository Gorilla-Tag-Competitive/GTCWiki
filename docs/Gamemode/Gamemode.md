# GTC game mode

## Basics of the Gamemode
The gamemode is played as a 3v3 or 4v4. Each team will start out with one player tagged. 
Whenever someone is tagged there goal is to tag the other team. 
The goal of the untagged players (runners) is to stay alive for as long as posssible. 
The team with the last standing player is the winner.

The runners will start anywhere within the forest map exept for walls. The taggers will start on the concrete at gazebo. 
The taggers will leave the gazebo and start chasing runners after the 3 second count down from the ref.

The gamemode is played on a 30 minute timer. 
When the timer ends the team with the higher number of points is the winner.
