# GTC Rules and Regulations

## Where We Moderate
We strive to maintain a judicious approach to moderation, mindful of the importance of privacy and respect for diverse social dynamics. While we are steadfastly opposed to negative behaviors, we recognize that interpersonal interactions in private settings may differ from the norms we uphold. Accordingly, we have established guidelines for our moderating activities. In essence, we will monitor public channels in any server related to Gorilla Tag, including the main server and public servers for semi-pro teams. Exceptions may apply to private channels or servers where all members agree to certain terms, in which case we will not intervene unless evidence indicates a violation of our exceptions. In group chats and private messages, individuals must explicitly consent to rule-breaking, subject to the same exceptions. Finally, while private games with friends are exempt, public lobbies, code GTC, and all scrimmages and matches, regardless of official status, are subject to our moderation policies. [Please report anything that you want even if it's not in our area of moderation but we store all info on people, it could help us discuss and determine future bans.]
