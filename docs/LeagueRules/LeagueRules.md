#### [A] When A player Joins a team they have 3 days to decide to stay on that team, In these 3 days that player is not allowed to participate in any official matches for any reason.
- If a player was banned then unbanned but never left team, then rule does not apply
- If the match admin agrees to let a player play in a official match within the 3 days it can be allowed, but there would have to be really special causes for that to happen
- If a player does not wish to stay on the team, they may leave and the 3 day rule resets when they join another team

#### [B] When a player joins a team they have a contract for 2 weeks + the 3 intermission days so 17 days in totality.
- If a team initiates contract with someone they may kick that player from the team, however the kicked player is stuck with the contract for 2 weeks
- Teams may not initiate a contract with a player from their opponent's team that week. 
- If a player leaves a team they will still have the contract for the 2 weeks

- If a member is found to be under age, we will temp ban them until they turn 13
- We only ban younger then 13 due to the TOS of discord and Gorilla tag

#### [C] Only ONE!! Captain & ONE!! Co-captain can be registered for your team
- We do allow split ownership of a team, but one person must assume captain role and co-captain role. 
- Captain position is completely separate from a team player position, so a captain spot does not take up a spot on the team, however the captain cannot participate in comp - - scrims or matches.
